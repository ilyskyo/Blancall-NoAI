**Not "blank all", but "recall".** Blancall turns any article into fill-in-the-blank exercises, helping you truly memorize what matters — in a modern, efficient, and trustworthy way.

Blancall is an open-source project that converts any article into cloze practice. Review scheduling is powered by the forgetting curve, and all data stays on your device — nothing goes to the cloud.

The standard (NoAI) edition **contains no AI modules whatsoever**: no AI integration, no AI settings, no AI entry points — a pure, complete, fully offline practice tool.

## Highlights

Blancall turns any article into cloze practice and uses memory science to help you truly remember.

**Six core selling points**:

- **Four practice modes** — sentence cloze / keyword cloze / reverse dictation / custom cloze, a progressive path covering every memory level
- **Daily sentence card** — one sentence auto-picked each day; three-key ratings feed the FSRS scheduler, so fragmented time still moves review forward
- **Handwritten answers (in-house models)** — self-trained recognition models (7,356 Chinese classes / 47 Latin classes) running on-device via NCNN: write it, and it gets graded
- **Reading-page masking** — mask the original text right on the reading page; read and memorize in one place
- **Custom cloze & mask positions** — mark exam points sentence-by-sentence / word-by-word / character-by-character, saved as named presets you can reuse anytime
- **Multi-format import** — paste / TXT / PDF (with preview) / Word, auto-split into sentences and paragraphs; start marking key points right after import

**The learning loop**:

### 1. Core Practice Engine

| Feature | What it does | When to use | What you get |
|---|---|---|---|
| Multi-format import | Paste text, or import TXT, PDF (with preview), Word, etc.; automatic sentence/paragraph splitting; one-tap suggested title; oversized text is trimmed with a warning; "Save & Cloze" jumps straight into marking | Textbooks, handouts, papers, recitation outlines, exam materials | Turn any article into practice material in seconds, no manual prep |
| Four practice modes | ① Sentence cloze: hide parts of sentences, recall from context; ② Keyword cloze: hide key words to sharpen accuracy; ③ Reverse dictation: shuffle paragraphs, restore in full; ④ Custom cloze: apply pre-marked positions | Sentence mode for first pass, keyword mode for consolidation, reverse dictation before exams, custom for key points | A progressive path: structure → details → full recall |
| Four cloze granularities | Complex sentence / clause / word / single character; long-press during practice to cycle | Adjust difficulty as you improve | Train the same article from "glance and fill" down to dictation level |
| Three cloze strategies | Balanced, Weakness-first (targets your past mistakes), Full coverage; switch anytime via the "⋮" menu | Daily practice, targeted review, stage testing | What gets hidden is driven by your error data, not luck |
| Cross-article mixing | Long-press in "My Articles", select 2+ articles, practice with mixed cloze | Term review; breaking single-article context dependence | Cure the "won't recall it in another article" problem |
| Weakness drills | From a practice record tap "Review ›", or enter from the "Due" card, to practice only your past mistakes | Pre-exam gap filling | Practice time goes exactly where it matters |
| Resume practice | The "Continue" card restores unfinished practice with full state | Interruptions (class, commute, bedtime) | Stop and resume anytime, zero friction |
| Two-level hints | Toggle hints mid-practice; partial answers help you through blocks; weak and strong hint levels | Beginners, stuck moments, turning hints off for exam simulation | You control hint strength; ramp up to pure recall |
| Immersion & section mode | Enable immersion to block distractions; split long articles into sections and practice selected ones | Practicing in public; tackling very long texts | Focus on demand; long articles stop being intimidating |
| Smart grading & error diagnosis | Punctuation tolerance; CJK/Latin mixed-text tolerance (full/half width, case, decimal points); edit-distance diagnosis of typos / missing / extra / wrong-order characters with a similarity score | Poetry and prose dictation, foreign-language passages, character-level checks | No more failing on a comma; you learn *which kind* of mistake you made |
| Daily sentence card | One sentence per day: due reviews first, otherwise a new sentence rotating across articles; swipe up/down; rate with Forgot / Shaky / Got it | Two minutes a day of sentence-level memory | A zero-friction daily habit that compounds |
| Offline handwriting | Switch to handwritten answers: built-in local recognition (NCNN, fully offline), Chinese model with 7,356 classes (HWDB full set: 7,185 characters + 171 alphanumerics), Latin model with 47 classes (EMNIST); embedded board, pressure-aware ink, automatic character splitting for continuous writing | Stylus dictation; testing memory through real writing | Handwriting mirrors real exams, and recognition never leaves the device |

### 2. Memory Science Engine

| Feature | What it does | When to use | What you get |
|---|---|---|---|
| FSRS-6 scheduling | The FSRS-6 algorithm (ported from Anki's fsrs-rs, default 90% target retention) schedules every item; sentence-card ratings feed the scheduler | All long-term memory management | Reviews land at the edge of forgetting, automatically |
| Forgetting prediction | Predicts each item's memory strength; due items surface via the "Due" card | The first thing to check each day | Review at minimum cost for maximum retention |
| Adaptive difficulty | Adjusts future cloze difficulty from your accuracy history | Long-term use as content grows | Difficulty tracks your level — neither discouraging nor wasteful |
| Memory heatmap & decay curve | Heatmap of overall memory strength; decay curve visualizes forgetting trends | Stage reviews; pre-exam assessment | See your readiness at a glance |

### 3. Reading & Organizing

| Feature | What it does | When to use | What you get |
|---|---|---|---|
| Immersive reading | Font size, line height, typeface, weight, palette, occlusion granularity; pinch to zoom; vector rendering stays crisp | Pre-class reading, bedtime review | A reading experience tuned to your eyes, closing the read → mark → practice loop |
| Custom occlusion marking | Switch occlusion to "Custom" and mark sentences / words / characters; save multiple named configurations | Highlighting key exam points | Practice always lands on what you marked as important |
| Personalized home | Long-press to edit: drag, resize, pin, add/remove cards; pull-down brand header; custom logo & subtitle | Tailoring the home screen | Your most-used actions one tap away |
| Local reminders | Daily study reminders via local notifications, time and cadence adjustable | Forgetting to practice | A gentle nudge, generated entirely on-device |

### 4. Insights & Motivation

| Feature | What it does | When to use | What you get |
|---|---|---|---|
| Global statistics | Practice counts, accuracy, mode distribution, trends; calendar view of daily volume | Weekly / monthly review | Consistency made visible |
| Per-article stats & records | Per-article attempts, accuracy, total time; every session inspectable | Checking one article's progress | Know what's solid and what's shaky at a glance |
| Multi-dimensional charts | Radar chart, error-type bar chart (typo / missing / extra / wrong-order, down to the character), memory decay curve | Analyzing error composition | Know whether you err on characters or on order |
| Needs-work recommendations | Automatically surfaces your lowest-accuracy articles | When you don't know what to practice | The system decides for you |
| Achievements | Milestone-based positive feedback | Long-term persistence | Motivation built in |
| Share cards | One-tap branded result posters | Sharing progress | Let your effort be seen |

### 5. Import & Export

| Feature | What it does | When to use | What you get |
|---|---|---|---|
| PDF test paper export | Export a practice session as a printable PDF | Paper-based self-testing, mock exams | Practice beyond the screen |
| CSV record export | Export all practice records as CSV | Analysis, backup, migration | Your data is always yours to take |

### 6. Privacy & Security

- **Local-only storage**: articles and practice data never leave your device. No account, no cloud, no forced upload.
- **Fully offline capable**: every feature works without a network.
- **No AI modules**: no AI code paths, settings, or entry points exist in the app — not "switched off", but "never there". Ideal for users with strict privacy needs or no want for AI.

### 7. Edition Comparison

| Capability | Blancall NoAI (this repo) | Blancall (Pro edition) |
|---|---|---|
| Core practice / memory engine / stats / handwriting / import-export | ✅ Full | ✅ Full |
| AI study assistant (own API / AI cloze / web search / chat history) | ❌ No AI modules at all | ✅ Pro exclusive |
| Best for | Users who want a pure, privacy-first practice tool | Users who want AI question generation, Q&A, and error analysis |

> Positioning: **AI removed, nothing else missing**. Every non-AI capability matches the Pro edition — this is not a "crippled" version, but the complete edition for people who don't need AI.

## FAQ

**Why is there no APK?**

The project is open-sourced as source code for learning, research, and self-building. No prebuilt installers are distributed.

**Standard (NoAI) or Pro?**

The only functional difference is AI — see the edition comparison above. Choose this repository for a pure, fully offline practice tool; choose Pro ([Blancall](https://github.com/ilyskyo/Blancall)) for AI cloze, Q&A, and web verification.

**Does it need the internet?**

Not at all. Every feature works offline, and the app contains no AI modules to begin with.
